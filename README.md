- Profile and settings management, allowing users to update their account details and log out
- Dashboard providing access to diary entries, mood tracking, and a period calendar
- Period calendar for logging cycle start and end dates, including retrospective entries
- Mood and symptom tracking associated with menstrual cycles, with calendar-based navigation
- Daily diary feature for journaling and logging personal notes
- Visual dashboard displaying tracked data using charts and summaries (e.g. mood trends, flow intensity, energy levels)
- Basic monthly cycle estimates based on previously logged data
- Integration of an external API to display current weather information
- Clean, minimalistic user interface following Material Design principles

## Tech Stack

## My Contribution
This project was initially undertaken as part of a university group assignment.

My individual contributions include:
- Designing and developing Android UI components using Kotlin
- Structuring app navigation and screen flow
- Designing and implementing the complete mood tracking feature, including various user input and visual presentation
- Managing local data storage for mood entries and user input
- Applying Material Design principles to ensure the app's accessibility and usability
- Creating wireframes to plan out user flows and screen layouts
- Testing app functionality and UI across different Android configurations

This repository represents the final consolidated version of the project rather than the full group development history.
